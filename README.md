# DevAccelerateTerraformTask

 Assessment :
Put all your Terraform configuration files  in a separate repo ( terraform) in your github account  Feel free to refer to resource 1.1.4 when working on the task if you get stuck.

Set up your AWS(or any cloud)) account ( if you do not have already, please  create it as we want this task to be run on AWS only for the sake of this assessment)

Install Terraform 

Create a terraform manifest to deploy 1 instance ( commit the manifest to github)

Plan and apply your configuration ( show a screenshot of the plan and apply  output )

Confirm your instance is running (show a screenshot of the running instance in whatever cloud provider you chose)

Create a new manifest to deploy 20 instances and apply it.

Using terraform , deploy a cluster of 6 web servers ( for high availability - use Auto Scaling for this)

Create configuration files to Deploy a load balancer ( deploy the load balancer )

Lastly destroy all the resources created but commit all your manifest to Github and share the URL ( Ensure to test your manifest by running Terraform apply  , as this is the only thing we should run to be able to test your code is working and it is able to spin up all the resources at once )
